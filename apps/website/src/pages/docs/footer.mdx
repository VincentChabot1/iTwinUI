The footer is fixed to the bottom of a web page, and contains your typical legally required links. The legal footer is only required to be displayed on pages that are considered a “main entry point into your application”. This means that the sign in and home page of any hub / app are good places to display the footer. You do not need to display the footer within an App UI widget, or deeper pages within an app. You can not include the footer on a page with infinite scrolling because you can not reach the bottom of the page.

## Appearance

The footer text is centered within the frame it is being displayed within, not centered within the viewport. This takes into consideration things that indent the body frame such as the side navigation.


If you feel the need to add additional links, you may append links to the end of the footer’s first line.

## Props

<PropsTable path={frontmatter.propsPath} />
